plugin ideas:
- Mult with labels
  - so I can route a distance output to mult and label
    it as 'main seq gate output' to avoid tracing cables
- seq with start/stop/reset triggers (ie, one shot sequencer)
  (or 'play', 'pause', 'go to begin')
  - solve 'how do I run a sequence once?' FAQ
- event log
  - visualization of past triggers/gates
  - time series or sparkline-ish
  - more or less a scope but without y values and
    a very long time
  - could do diff colors for gates/triggers
    - or gates up and triggers down
  - wide module
  - multiple time view zooms
    - 1x, 2x, 5x, 10, 20x, 50x, etc
  - mostly for appearance or troubleshooting/debugging event stuff
  - could evolve to supporting playing the the history back
    - 1x speed or faster/slower
    - scrubbing?
  - multiple channels of events
